# nfltadR
A simple package for generating fantasy football projections using machine learning. The name is a play on `nflfastR`, a highly utilized package by many armchair analysts for accessing NFL data. This R package offers many useful functions for conditioning data from `nflreadR` and `nflfastR` and writes the condition data to a local MySQL (relational) database. It then trains and offers a series of optimized, cross-validated XGBoost models and builds a `draft_board` table in the MySQL database to store the fantasy-point projections for the upcoming season. All of this can be done by simply calling the `get_data(min_year, max_year)` function exposed by the package to acquire and condition data and write the result to the database and then calling `run_projections` to query this data from the database and build XGBoost models for each scoring system (standard and points-per-reception) and classic position (quarterback, running back, wide receiver, and tight end). Projections from these models for the upcoming models are what is written to the draft board table in the database. The result is a validated, data-driven full projection and draft suite achievable at your fingertips with just two function calls.
